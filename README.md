# IBMi-topics-thanks-to-pub400
This repository retains the topics I am able to work on, thanks to the availability of a free developer access to [PUB400](https://pub400.com/) which is an IBM i instance running the very last available version of IBM i on a POWER9 IBM server.
As I am retired now for a couple of years, this activity is the one of an hobbyist therefore the updates will come without any notice.
There are several areas I work on to publish them here. It can be HowTo's, programming topics, using RPGLE, CLLE, SQL languages.
