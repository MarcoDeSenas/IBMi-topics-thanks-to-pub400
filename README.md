# IBMi-topics-thanks-to-pub400
This repository retains the topics I am able to work on, thanks to the availability of a free developer access to [PUB400](https://pub400.com/). This is an IBM i instance running the very last available version 7.5 of [IBM i](https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-i) on a [POWER9](https://www.ibm.com/power) IBM server.
As I am retired now for a couple of years, this activity is the one of an hobbyist therefore the updates will come without any notice.
There are several areas I work on to publish them here. It can be HowTo's, programming topics, using RPGLE, CLLE, SQL languages.

Available here topics are organized in folders, which are independant each other. All discussions, questions, issues are welcome, and anyone can use the materiels as soon as one applies the LICENSE terms (based on GPL v3.0 license).
