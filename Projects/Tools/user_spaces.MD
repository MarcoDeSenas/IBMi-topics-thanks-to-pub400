# User spaces Management

This set of tools provides ways to handle user spaces content from a program. It gets some inspiration from the famous TAATOOL suite of utilities, and more specifically, the [user spaces category](https://www.taatool.com/document/C_usrspc.html). These tools are intended to help managing the content of a user space filled up with the output of List APIs, such as QUSLJOB.

Two kinds of tools are expected in this topic.

The first one provides functions within a service program to create a user space, retrieve its information and attributes and retrieve its entries. They are intended to be used from a program.
The second one provides CL commands to fulfill the same objectives. They are intended to be used from a CL(LE) program.
